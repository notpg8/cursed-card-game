# Cursed Card Gameâ„¢

### TO DO:

- light theme switch
- game mechanic rules
- re-host all pictures elsewhere (or maybe github is good as well with direct links)
- persisting data
- create room to play with a friend
- assign socket ids to players
- prevent card spam pushing to array (too many cards while developing)
- on refresh page remove all data (remove cards, score, etc)
- add deck instead of button
- remove boxing glove in favor of a triangle popping up behind the card when it's selected (give it an up and down animation) (when hovering it should come out more)
