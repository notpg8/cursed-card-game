# Cursed Card Gameâ„¢

### TO DO:

- light theme switch
- game mechanic rules
- re-host all pictures elsewhere (or maybe github is good as well with direct links)
- persisting data
- create room to play with a friend
- VS screen
- erasing single cards
- assign socket ids to players
- server to handle all actions and send back responses
- prevent card spam pushing to array (too many cards while developing)
- rarity should be set by class once the stats are populated. strongest === rarest
