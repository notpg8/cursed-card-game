# Cursed Card Gameâ„¢

### TO DO:

- hook up points of card on duel page instead of 999
- 1v1 strongest card wins and you earn a point
- best out of 5 wins
- add score somewhere eg. 3-2 at the bottom center small text
- add win/lose effect after duel screen closes
- light theme switch
- game mechanic rules
- re-host all pictures elsewhere (or maybe github is good as well with direct links)
- persisting data
- create room to play with a friend
- erasing single cards
- assign socket ids to players
- server to handle all actions and send back responses
- prevent card spam pushing to array (too many cards while developing)
- add scoreboard
- add mechanics to track the current score. if you want a new card while you still have others available on the board, you lose a score point. if you have zero score points, you can't get new cards
